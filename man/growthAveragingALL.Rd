\details{
Radial-growth averaging criteria developed by Nowacki & Abrams (1997) is one of the most often used techniques from this category. This method computes the percentage growth change (\%GC) between average radial growth over the preceding 10-year period, M1 (including the target year), and average radial growth over the subsequent 10-year period, M2 (excluding the target year): \%GC = [(M2-M1)/M1] * 100. Minimum threshold for release is 25\% growth change for moderate and >50\% for major release. The advantage of this method is its broad applicability even for a small number of samples, and that information about species autecology is not necessary. On the other hand, this generality of radial-growth averaging may lead to detection of false releases and missing of true releases (Black & Abrams 2003; Fraver & White 2005). These inaccuracies are primarily caused by different growth rates in young, small, and suppressed trees when compared to older, larger and dominant trees.
