\details{Boundary-line method scales the  percent growth change of Nowacki & Abrams (1997) according to growth rate prior to disturbance. In their example, Black & Abrams (2003) defined moderate and major releases as those falling within 20-49.9\%, and 50-100\% of the boundary line, respectively. Advantage of the boundary-line is standardization, which takes into account the relationships among tree age, size, and canopy class determining radial growth rate (Black et al. 2004). On the downside, Black et al. (2009) suggest approximately 50000 ring width measurements is necessary for boundary line determination for a given species (Black et al. 2009).
