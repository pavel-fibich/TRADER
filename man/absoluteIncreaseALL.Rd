%%     ~~Describe \code{gfun} here~~
}
  \item{length}{Determines how many years have to be given critera exceeded to be considered as release.
%%     ~~Describe \code{length} here~~
}
  \item{storedev}{Format for saving the graphical outputs, eg. pdf or jpeg.

\details{In cases where species autecology (mean growth rate, species sensitivity, and range of growth responses) is well known, it is possible to determine the absolute threshold for release detection, instead of thresholds based on relative growth. Empirically determined absolute-increase threshold for each species roughly corresponded to 1.25 times the standard deviation (Fraver & White 2005). The absolute-increase method has only one threshold, and no distinction is made between moderate and major releases.
