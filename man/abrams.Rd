%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
There is a split of behaviour of this function according parameter \code{black}. }
\details{
  If \bold{ black=TRUE}: Boundary-line method scales the  percent growth change of Nowacki & Abrams (1997) according to growth rate prior to disturbance. In their example, Black & Abrams (2003) defined moderate and major releases as those falling within 20-49.9\%, and 50-100\% of the boundary line, respectively. Advantage of the boundary-line is standardization, which takes into account the relationships among tree age, size, and canopy class determining radial growth rate (Black et al. 2004). On the downside, Black et al. (2009) suggest approximately 50000 ring width measurements is necessary for boundary line determination for a given species (Black et al. 2009).
\cr
  If \bold{black=FALSE}: Radial-growth averaging criteria developed by Nowacki & Abrams (1997) is one of the most often used techniques from this category. This method computes the percentage growth change (\%GC) between average radial growth over the preceding 10-year period, M1 (including the target year), and average radial growth over the subsequent 10-year period, M2 (excluding the target year): \%GC = [(M2-M1)/M1] * 100. Minimum threshold for release is 25\% growth change for moderate and >50\% for major release. The advantage of this method is its broad applicability even for a small number of samples, and that information about species autecology is not necessary. On the other hand, this generality of radial-growth averaging may lead to detection of false releases and missing of true releases (Black & Abrams 2003; Fraver & White 2005). These inaccuracies are primarily caused by different growth rates in young, small, and suppressed trees when compared to older, larger and dominant trees.
